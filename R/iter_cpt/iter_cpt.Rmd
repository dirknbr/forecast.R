# More granular change points 

The `changepoint` library seems to find only very few change points in mean, so here I show an extension which slices the time series and then walks trough it finding more local change points.

```{r}
iter_cpt <- function(x, step = 100) {
  # function to find multiple mean change points using cpt by slicing the data
  # Args:
  #  x: vector
  #  step: integer step size
  # Returns:
  #  vector of points
  n <- length(x)
  stopifnot(step < n)
  a <- 1
  b <- step
  points <- c()
  while (b < n) {
    cp <- cpt.mean(x[a:b])
    p <- cp@cpts[1] + (a - 1)
    if (p %in% points) {
      a <- a + step
    } else {
      points <- c(points, p)
      a <- p
    }
    b <- min(n, a + step)
    cat(a, b, p, '\n')
  }
  return(points)
}

plot_iter_cpt <- function(x, points) {
  # plot changing mean given many change points
  # Args:
  #  x: vector
  #  points: vector of integer points
  
  stopifnot(max(points) <= length(x))
  means <- c()
  a <- 1
  points <- c(points, length(x))
  for (b in points) {
    m <- mean(x[a:b])
    cat(a, b, m, '\n')
    means <- c(means, rep(m, b - a + 1))
    a <- b + 1
  }
  matplot(cbind(x, means), type = 'l', ylab = 'x and mean')
}

library(changepoint)
library(quantmod)

# test with some simulated data
x <- c(rnorm(90, 10, 1), rnorm(90, 12, 1), rnorm(90, 14, 1))
points <- iter_cpt(x, 100)
plot_iter_cpt(x, points)

getSymbols('AAPL')
plot(AAPL)
x2 <- as.data.frame(AAPL)[, 4]

# use cpt.mean on total series
plot(cpt.mean(x2))

points2 <- iter_cpt(x2, 300)
plot_iter_cpt(x2, points2)
```
